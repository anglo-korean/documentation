# On Minimum Score

Every forecast has a *Confidence Score* between 0 and 1. A *Confidence Score* of 0 means that the forecast is a total guess. A *Confidence Score* of 1 means that this forecast is, in effect, a prophecy. In reality, *Confidence Scores* tend to range between 0.3 and 0.99.

By setting the minimum score you're interested in at the token level, you avoid dealing with forecasts you may find to be of low quality.

Each plan has a minimum score, too; if you select a minimum score below the plan level then your choice is ignored. For the hobby plan, the minimum is 0.75, which discards about 30% of forecasts.
